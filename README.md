## note
In some cases , I used hints from discussions part, or by searching on web, in those cases i implement my own solution,well understood , i could not escape similarity in most cases, obviously because they are so simple and there is just a way to solve, in some question this matter is mentioned as comments.
In most problems there was no need to clarify by comments, in some more complicated cases , comments aid to understand the code.
